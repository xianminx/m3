# Schema Theory in Reading

## Definition of Schema

### Schema Theory Overview
- **Schema Theory**: Explains how readers use prior knowledge to comprehend and learn from text.
- **Origin**: 
  - First used in psychology by Barlett (1932).
  - Defined as "an active organization of past reactions or experiences".

### Introduction to Reading
- **Introduction by Researchers**: 
  - Rumelhart (1980), Carrell (1981), and Hudson (1982) introduced schema in reading.
  - Emphasized the role of background knowledge in reading comprehension.
- **Rumelhart (1980)**: Defined schema as "a data structure for representing the genetic concepts stored in memory".
- **Anderson and Pearson (1984)**: Defined schema as "an abstract knowledge structure".
- **Medin and Russ (1992)**: Defined schema simply as "a general knowledge structure used for understanding".

### Key Tenets of Schema Theory
- **Text and Meaning**: 
  - Written text does not carry meaning by itself.
  - Text provides directions for readers to retrieve or construct meaning using prior knowledge.
- **Background Knowledge**: 
  - Referred to as the reader’s prior knowledge.
  - Organized into structures called schemata.
- **Hierarchical Organization**: 
  - Schemata are organized hierarchically.
  - Most general schemata are at the top; more specific ones are at the bottom.
- **Interactive Process**: 
  - Comprehending a text is an interactive process between the reader’s background knowledge and the text.
  - Efficient comprehension requires relating the textual material to one’s own knowledge.

### Reading Comprehension
- **Anderson (1977)**: 
  - "Every act of comprehension involves one’s knowledge of the world".
- **Reading Processes**: 
  - Operate in two directions: bottom-up and top-down.
- **Bottom-Up Processing**: 
  - Activated by specific data from the text.
- **Top-Down Processing**: 
  - Starts with general predictions based on higher-level schemata.
  - Searches for specific details to confirm these predictions.
- **Simultaneous Interaction**: 
  - Bottom-up and top-down processes occur simultaneously and interactively.
  - This interaction is crucial for comprehension.

### Summary of Key Points
- **Schema Theory**: Central to understanding how readers use prior knowledge for comprehension.
- **Hierarchical Schemata**: Organize knowledge from general to specific.
- **Interactive Reading**: Combines bottom-up and top-down processes for efficient comprehension.


## Types of Schemata

### Formal Schema
- **Definition**: Knowledge of formal, rhetorical organizational structures of texts.
- **Carrel and Eisterhold (1983)**: Formal schema refers to knowledge of how different genres are presented.
- **Example**: 
  - **Story Schema**: Setting (time, place, characters) + Episodes (events) + Reaction.
  - **Genre Variations**: Different genres have different structures, e.g., stories, descriptions, letters, reports, poems.
- **Importance**: Lack of knowledge in formal schema contributes to reading comprehension problems.

### Content Schema
- **Definition**: Background knowledge of the content area of the text.
- **Carrel and Eisterhold (1983)**: Content schema contains conceptual knowledge about typical events and entities within a topic.
- **Example**: 
  - **Restaurant Schema**: Includes services, menus, ordering dishes, paying the bill.
- **Culture-Specific**: Content schema is often culture-specific.
- **Cultural Schema**: Usually categorized as content schema, relating to general aspects of cultural knowledge shared by larger sections of a cultural population.

### Cultural Schema
- **Definition**: Knowledge of beliefs, attitudes, customs, behaviors, and social habits of a particular society.
- **Richard et al. (2000)**: Culture is the total set of beliefs, attitudes, customs, behaviors, social habits, etc., of a society.
- **Rivers and Temperly (1978)**: Cultural knowledge or "socio-cultural meaning" springs from shared experiences, values, and attitudes.
- **Impact on Reading**: 
  - **Studies by Johnson (1981) and Carrel (1981)**: Cultural knowledge presupposed by a text interacts with the reader's cultural background, making culturally familiar texts easier to understand.
  - **Different Interpretations**: Different groups may interpret the same texts differently, as shown in Steffenson et al. (1979) study.
- **Sensitivity**: Important to be sensitive to cultural differences for efficient comprehension.

### Linguistic Schema
- **Definition**: Knowledge about vocabulary and grammar.
- **Basic Role**: Plays a fundamental role in understanding texts.
- **Eskey (1988)**: 
  - Good readers are both decoders and interpreters.
  - Decoding skills become more automatic but remain important.
  - Language is a major problem in second language reading.
  - Accurate decoding is essential for successful comprehension.
- **Comprehension**: Impossible without effective decoding skills.



## Schema Activation and Instantiation

### Schema Activation
- **Definition**: The process where textual stimuli signal the direction or area for the reader to search and evoke the relevant schema from memory.
- **Textual Stimuli**: 
  - Specific words or groups of words, or the title of a text, that suggest certain schemata.
  - Example: Mention of "fire brigade" may activate a "fire accident" schema.
- **Two Ways Textual Stimuli Affect Schema**:
  - **Direct Activation**: When a stimulus is highly suggestive of a certain schema, it activates the schema as a whole.
    - Example: "Fire brigade" directly activates "fire accident" schema.
  - **Slot Filling**: When a single stimulus is insufficient for activation, it may suggest a slot that fits into several schemata.
    - Example: "Acid" may suggest slots for "acid rain", "food processing", etc.
    - As more stimuli are provided, possibilities narrow down to a specific schema.
      - Example: Adding "litmus paper", "Bunsen burner", and "test tube" to "acid" narrows it to a "chemistry lab" schema.

### Schema Instantiation
- **Definition**: The process of filling the abstract and stereotypical schemata with specific instances during reading.
- **Abstract Schemata**: Contain slots or placeholders for each constituent element in a knowledge structure.
- **Reader's Role**: Constructs a correspondence between relevant schemata and the known elements of a message.
- **Example Process**:
  - Sentences: "He picked up his axe. He held it softly for a moment and blew sharp notes through its bell. The crowd listened and cheered him; they loved his saxophone playing."
    - Initial Interpretation: "Axe" schema produced.
    - Second Sentence: "Blew", "sharp notes", and "bell" conflict with "axe" schema.
    - Third Sentence: Reconciliation to "saxophone" schema.
  - Importance: Comprehension entails drawing from both the message and internal schemata until reconciled as a single schema or message.

### Practical Implications
- **Schema Theory in Reading**: Guides the process of making sense of new experiences and enables predictions about expected experiences.
- **Integral Schema Teaching Model**: Emphasizes positive intercommunication between reader and writer, focusing on background knowledge's role in comprehension.

## Text Types, Text Patterns, and Text Strategies

### Text Types
- **Classifications**: 
  - **Text-External Criteria**: Related to communication situations, e.g., reports, poems, jokes, letters, advertisements, stories, lectures.
  - **Text-Internal Criteria**: Related to form and content, e.g., expository, descriptive, narrative, argumentative, persuasive, evaluative, procedural.
- **Kinneavy's Grouping (1980)**: 
  - **Expressive Texts**: Focus on the author.
  - **Persuasive Texts**: Focus on readers.
  - **Inferential Texts**: Focus on topics.
  - Further classification by facts: Descriptive (static state), narrative (dynamic state), evaluative (choices on current state).

### Text Patterns
- **Common Patterns**:
  - **Problem-Solution Pattern**: 
    - Example: "Situation: I was on sentry duty. Problem: I saw the enemy approaching. Solution: I tried to open fire. Response: I beat off the attack."
  - **Claim-Counterclaim Pattern**: 
    - Example: "Initial Claim: On Food and Cooking is brilliant. Counterclaim: It has mistakes, omissions, and misalignments."
  - **Narrative Pattern**: 
    - Labov's (1972) Structure: Abstraction, orientation, complicating events, evaluation, resolution, coda.
  - **Question-Answer Pattern**: 
    - Sets a distinct question and searches for a satisfying answer.
  - **General-Specific Pattern**: 
    - Structure: General statement followed by detailed statements, ending with a general statement.

### Text Strategies
- **Definition**: General decision-making and choice of text production process.
- **Continuity Styles**:
  - **Time Continuity**: 
    - Realized by a time chain at the front of the sentence or paragraph.
    - Sometimes includes non-adverbial time expressions.
  - **Place Continuity**: 
    - Realized by an adverbial chain.
    - Includes continuity of non-adverbial markers at the beginning of a sentence or paragraph.
  - **Action Continuity**: 
    - Composed of figures, animals, or entities treated as figures.
  - **Topic Continuity**: 
    - Composed of signified non-figure or non-animal entities.
    - Often occurs in explanatory or argumentative passages.
  - **Action Continuity**: 
    - Conveys new information.
- **Purpose of Text Strategies**: 
  - Help readers decode text efficiently and correctly.
  - Establish a text strategy schema in the reader’s mind.
### Functions of Text Strategies
- **Macrostructure**:
  - Helps readers decode text acroscopically, efficiently, and correctly.
  - Establishes a text strategy schema in the reader's mind.


## Functions of Reading Schema
- **Anticipating Function**: 
  - Readers guess the type of text.
  - Anticipate topics based on the text type.
  - Use context to guess the latter part of the text.
- **Supplementary Function**: 
  - Activate corresponding psychological schema when information is insufficient.
  - Supplement missing information during reading.
- **Selective Process**: 
  - Schema selects the most appropriate part to explain the reading material.
  - After reading, schema helps sort and organize the information.

## Reading Models
- **Bottom-Up Model**: 
  - Specific data from the text activates processing.
- **Top-Down Model**: 
  - General predictions guide the search for specific details.
- **Interactive Model**: 
  - Combines bottom-up and top-down processing.
  - Interaction at three levels:
    - Between bottom-up and top-down processing.
    - Between lower-level and higher-level skills.
    - Between reader’s background knowledge and text's background knowledge.
  - Readers use both types of processing interchangeably to construct comprehension.

## Practical Implications
- **Schema Theory in Reading**: 
  - Guides the process of understanding new experiences.
  - Enables predictions about expected experiences.
- **Integral Schema Teaching Model**: 
  - Emphasizes positive interaction between reader and writer.
  - Focuses on the function of background knowledge in reading comprehension.

## Conclusion
- **Reading Schema**: 
  - Has anticipating, supplementary, and selective functions.
  - Enhances understanding and comprehension of text.
- **Schema Theory**: 
  - Provides a framework for understanding the reading process.
  - Emphasizes the interaction between reader’s background knowledge and textual material.
