                We may employ the use of third-party services for the purpose of

            <h2>4. Contests, Sweepstakes, and Promotions</h2>

            </p>

            <h2>5. Subscriptions</h2>
            <p>
                Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
                ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a
                recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles
                are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the
                type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a
                Subscription.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will
                automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you
                cancel it or s15n cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription
                renewal either through your online account management page or by
                contacting [Contact Email] customer support team.
            </p>
            <p>
                A valid payment method is required to process the payment for
                your subscription. You shall provide s15n with accurate and
                complete billing information that may include but not be limited
                to full name, address, state, postal or zip code, telephone
                number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting
                such payment information, you automatically authorize s15n to
                charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to
                any such payment instruments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, s15n will
                issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed
                manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment
                corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Free Trial</h2>
            <p>
                s15n may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a
                free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").
            </p>
            <p>
                You may be required to enter your billing information in order
                to sign up for the Free Trial.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do enter your billing information when signing up for a
                Free Trial, you will not be charged by s15n until the Free Trial
                has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless
                you canceled your Subscription, you will be automatically
                charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of
                Subscription you have selected.
            </p>
            <p>
                At any time and without notice, s15n reserves the right to (i)
                modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii)
                cancel such Free Trial offer.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Fee Changes</h2>
            <p>
                s15n, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify
                Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee
                change will become effective at the end of the then-current
                Billing Cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
                s15n will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change
                in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate
                your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your continued use of Service after the Subscription fee change
                comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified
                Subscription fee amount.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Refunds</h2>
            <p>
                Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by
                s15n on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion
                of s15n.
