                We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
                necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy,
                unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law

            <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
                organizational and technical security measures. However, despite
                our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
                electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage
                technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
                promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
                unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
                security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
                information.

            <h2>7. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
            <p>
                In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have
                certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may
                include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of
                your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or
                erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal
                information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
            <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
                applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting
                you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
                data about your online browsing activities monitored and
                collected.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Updates to this Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to
                reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other
                operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of
                any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page.
